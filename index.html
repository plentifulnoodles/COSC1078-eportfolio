    <br><br><p>Hello, my name is Franco, studying at RMIT as an undergraduate in Information technology  I was born and raised in the Philippines for 9 years; retaining my cultural and ethnical heritage. I am bilingual with both English and Filipino (plus a couple regional dialects to a lesser extent), being raised in Luzon as a child. I have completed my VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) qualifications as of 2021, graduating with a secondary Cert III in music performance. I am a multi-medalist award winning chess player, having obtained a dozen medals (have yet to get a trophy though!) over the course of 3 years in competitive chess. I also enjoy partaking in a small freelance art business doing commissions for clients interested enough, as a means of sporadic income. I also love working out and have been doing so for several months, as a means for recreational fun, as well as a long-term investment in health and fitness.  </p>
    <br><p>Technology has completely intrigued me ever since I was introduced to the concept at an early age. Having grown up in an environment and era where computers have been integral to our lifestyle, as well as having family heavily reliant on them as both a recreational and occupational perspective. With direct family connections, family bonding times can easily get insightful and productive as well as being fun. “If I can monetise from staring at a screen for massive time slots, I might as well do it” is how it was put into my perspective. </p>
    <br><p> chose RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) because of its proximity to Melbourne Central; both for logistical ease of access as well as having reviewed the university as an extensive proponent of information technology as a subject compared to the other options out there. Not only that, being accepted as a SNAP (School Network Access Program) participant from my earlier secondary college has allowed me an opportunity to enroll into my favourite preferred course. Coming into the course of a Bachelor’s in IT (Information Technology), I have, as expected, have chosen the necessary and relevant topics to progress into the coursework properly. Each of these topics provided have so far been proven an invaluable resource to extensively study over the preliminary stages of the first semester.  </p>
    <br><p>Working in a competitive and high-stake team environment and act as necessary infrastructure for a team to have cohesion within the unit, even in life-or-death situations. The importance of this role as well as so many other countless benefits as an associate within the ADF, further progressing into a better future and career, whilst improving myself as a person.</p>
    <br><p>A prior background in information technology to obtain preferential treatment and allocation within vacancies of army support. Otherwise, a minimum pass of high-school or equivalent as a requirement, as well as maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I have the necessary qualifications from an educational institution as per the VCE certificate. However, I am still currently working on that whole fitness aspect; so far it has been fulfilling progress. </p>
    <br><p>Firstly, regaining composure of myself as a person is of utmost importance. To achieve this, bettering myself as a person by improving my physical and mental fitness is paramount to this role. Afterwards, I will improve my work ethics and grit during tough times to raise my resilience even under pressure, while maintaining a calm and stoic nature. To finalise that process, I will then work on obtaining the necessary certificate by graduating from RMIT with a bachelor's degree in information technology.</p>
    <br><p>I personally consider myself a pragmatist, relying more on rational and logical reasoning based on previous experience via intuition. Having a website describe me as an INTJ-T person seems proper, given the process on how I learn. I very much enjoy being classified as a kinesthetic learner, because I find that physically working on a project or given equipment is a passion that I very much love, given the nature of how the lesson goes by. Having tools in order to obtain my goal is how I would utilise everything around me to obtain my goal. Because of this, being a proper reliable teammate helps me integrate within a given group by being a reliable and independent individual.</p>
        <br><p>My project plan regarding the coursework of Information technology is to fabricate a chess engine, capable of playing at a serviceable club level, with a setting to adapt to the skill level of the chess player simply just by playing with it. To start with this, I will play to the strengths of my learned abilities within class and create the program within Python, as well as borrowing the databases of several million existing games while analysing human games to replicate human-like moves. I wish to have it implemented within the RMIT chess club to highlight the capabilities of the students, as well as even representing it as a contender and player within the team to further advertise and encourage others about chess as a hobby. </p>
      <p>Chess has always been a global and internationally recognized sport and hobby, with over 800 million people knowing it, whether that would be casually in a pub or competitively in proper tournaments. Providing an application that is easy to access with a clean UI (User Interface) is key to further encouraging taking this hobby for those looking to learn new things, or even improve existing skills. Using the software and hardware within the typical PC (Personal Computers) is more than sufficient to run both a GPU-intensive engine, as well as Python.</p>
      <p>A functional laptop with a mid-high end range specification set to accommodate the intensive usage of memory required for a chess engine; Python to create the necessary code for the chess engine to function, being the main language used. Stockfish NNUE and Nibbler responsible to translate the information of a chess engine into a usable GUI (Graphical User Interface) for python to base the code on, as well as Leela Chess 0 neural network engine to emulate the human-like playstyle of the users to create a realistic opponent. </p>
      <p>A good amount of knowledge with python to be able to properly code the chess engine, as well as basic knowledge with the stockfish NNUE engine to be able to implement it properly with the interface of nibbler, into python. No specific hardware required, other than a working PC that can run at an acceptable rate. With the massive repositories of information out there in the bounds of the internet, finding necessary and relevant resources will not be too much of a hassle; as well as no requirement for a high-end PC if the user is unable to afford it, running effectively even on integrated graphics.</p>
      <p>Upon successful launch, this program will provide a massive opportunity for beginner and veteran chess players alike, all within the boundaries of the RMIT university, being publicly accessible for all students. It will provide the university with a means of accessing a locally crafted engine for both students and staff alike. This will (hopefully) revolutionise the chess scene of the university and improve public relations with the sport itself with the people. This project, if successful, will show the public the capabilities of the students within the IT department of school. </p>
